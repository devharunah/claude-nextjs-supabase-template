## Project context

**[Project name]** is [one sentence on what it is and who it serves].

**Stack**

- Framework: Next.js 16, App Router
- Language: TypeScript, strict
- UI: React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 through PostCSS
- Data: Supabase, via `@supabase/ssr`
- Package manager: pnpm, pinned in `packageManager`

**Layout**

| Path | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `src/app/` | Routes, layouts and pages |
| `src/lib/` | Pure modules and the Supabase clients |
| `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` | Server client. Reads cookies through `next/headers` |
| `src/lib/supabase/browser.ts` | Browser client |
| `src/lib/env.ts` | `requireEnv`. Every environment variable goes through it |
| `e2e/` | Playwright. Anything that renders or fetches belongs here |
| `**/__tests__/` | Jest. Pure modules only |
| `.claude/` | The Claude Code harness. See `.claude/README.md` |

## Environment

Never read `process.env` directly. Call `requireEnv` from `src/lib/env.ts`, so a missing variable
fails at the point of use with a message naming the variable and pointing at `.env.example`.

Add every new variable to `.env.example` in the same commit as the code that reads it. A variable
that only exists in someone's `.env.local` does not exist.

The service role key is server only. If a file that imports it is reachable from a client
component, that key ships to the browser.

## The test split

This is the line that decides where a test goes:

- **Jest** covers pure modules. No DOM that matters, no network, no Supabase.
- **Playwright** covers anything that renders, fetches or runs on the server. It boots the real
  app, so it is the only place that can prove a Server Action actually runs. A `"use server"`
  module typechecks cleanly and still fails the first time a person presses submit.

Jest and Playwright both claim `*.spec.ts` by default. `jest.config.cjs` ignores `e2e/`
explicitly. Without that, Jest collects the Playwright suite, finds no browser, and reports a wall
of failures that look like the unit tests broke. **Name unit tests `*.test.ts`.**

## Before you push

```bash
pnpm verify
```

That chains lint, typecheck, Jest and Playwright. Do not push if any step fails. Keep the branch
buildable at every commit.

## Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `docs`, `perf`, `ci`, `revert`.

Subject line in imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period, 72 characters at most. Breaking
changes take a `!` after the type or scope and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

Commit early and often. One logical change per commit, never unrelated changes bundled together.

## Branches

Never push to `main`. Everything goes through a PR, and `main` stays deployable.

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

CI runs on every PR and must be green before merge.

## What the harness adds

`.claude/` carries subagents, slash commands, skills, rules and hooks, vendored from
[everything-claude-code](https://github.com/devharunah/everything-claude-code). Read
`.claude/README.md` for what is there and what was changed from upstream.

**This file wins.** Where a vendored rule disagrees with anything above, the text here is the
answer. The vendored rules were written for a general audience and know nothing about this
project.
